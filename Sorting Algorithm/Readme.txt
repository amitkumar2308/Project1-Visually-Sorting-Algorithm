#Sorting Visualizer

A simple sorting visualizer using Tkinter in Python.

## Description

This project provides a user-friendly graphical representation of three popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. The visualization allows users to input a list of numbers and observe how each sorting algorithm processes the input step by step.

## Features

- **Graphical Representation:** The sorting process is visually displayed using bars, with each bar representing a number.
  
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Supports the following sorting algorithms:
  - **Bubble Sort:** Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - **Selection Sort:** Divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and adds it to the sorted region.
  - **Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by iteratively taking elements from the input data and inserting them into their correct position.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to input values and choose a sorting algorithm.
